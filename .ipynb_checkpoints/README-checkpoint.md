###  Objective: Develop a machine learning model that predicts a change in credit ratings for a corporate bond over the following 12 months 

## Summary
Obtained large datasets via SQL from a company active in corporate credit default probability modeling. Data cleaning played a major role in the project. 3 Classification Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boost were used to train/test the models and analyze the large historical dataframes. Having an imbalanced dataset with relatively few rating events turned out to be a key challenge. Random Forest and Gradient Boost models seem to outperform Logistic Regression model with balanced accuracy scores of about 83% using the original, imbalanced dataset. Potential future modeling improvements include enhancing the dataset, fine-tuning the models and optimizing target variables.
